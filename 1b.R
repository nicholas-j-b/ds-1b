#small script to address the problem of finding the geometric median
#generates random points with x value and y value each between 0 and 1
#calculates the mean of the x and y values separately and uses that as guess
#builds a raster over the [0,1]^2 region and calculates sum of distances to all points for each intersection
#iteratively zooms in on area surrounding minimum to refine raster
#compares final outcome with guess
